## `Initializing K-means`

> The very first step of the K means clustering algorithm, was to choose random locations as the initial guesses for the cluster centroids &mu;<sub>1</sub> through &mu;<sub>K</sub>. But how do you actually take that random guess. Let's take a look at that in this video, as well as how you can take multiple attempts at the initial guesses with &mu;<sub>1</sub> through &mu;<sub>K</sub>.

## `Pick randomly K examples as centroids`

- Doing so may result in these two scenarios below, where **initial choices of centroids can affect the clustering result.**

## `Solution: Run K-Means multiple times`

- Solution: Run K-Means multiple times and pick the result with the lowest cost.
