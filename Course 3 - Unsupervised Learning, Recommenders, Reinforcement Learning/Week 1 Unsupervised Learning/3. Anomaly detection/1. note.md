## `Finding unusual events`

> Let's look at our second unsupervised learning algorithm. **Anomaly detection algorithms** look at an unlabeled dataset of normal events and thereby learns to detect or to raise a red flag for if there is an unusual or an anomalous event.

> And the anomaly detection problem is, after the learning algorithm has seen these m examples of how aircraft engines typically behave in terms of how much heat is generated and how much they vibrate. If a brand new aircraft engine were to roll off the assembly line and it had a new feature vector given by x<sub>test</sub>, we'd like to know does this engine look similar to ones that have been manufactured before?

> But if this new aircraft engine has a heat and vibration signature that is say all the way down here, then this data point down here looks very different than ones we saw up on top. And so we will probably say, boy, this looks like an anomaly. This doesn't look like the examples I've seen before, we better inspect this more carefully before we let this engine get installed on an airplane. **How can you have an algorithm address this problem?**

## `Density estimation`

- Given the dataset, we will use model p(x) to calculate **the probability of x being seen in the dataset** and **compare it to a threshold eps** to decide if the data point is an anomaly or not.
