## `Gaussian (normal) distribution`

> In order to apply anomaly detection, we're going to need to use the **Gaussian distribution**, which is also called the **normal distribution**. When you hear me say either Gaussian distribution or normal distribution, they mean exactly the same thing. If you've heard the **bell-shaped distribution**, that also refers to the same thing. But if you haven't heard of the bell-shaped distribution, that's fine too. But let's take a look at what is the Gaussian or the normal distribution.

> You may have heard that probabilities always have to sum up to 1, so that's why the area under the curve is always equal to one, which is why when the Gaussian distribution becomes skinnier, it has to become taller as well.

## `Parameter estimation`

- Given a dataset, we first calculate **&mu;** and **&sigma;**
- Either <sup>1</sup>/m or <sup>1</sup>/(m-1) is okay to used in the formulas.

> Now, we've done this only for when x is a number, as if you had only a single feature for your anomaly detection problem. For practical anomaly detection applications, you usually have a lot of different features.
