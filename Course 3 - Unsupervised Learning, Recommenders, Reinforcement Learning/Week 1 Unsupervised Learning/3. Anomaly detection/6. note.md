## `Choosing what features to use`

> anomaly detection which learns just from unlabeled data, is harder for the algorithm to figure out what features to ignore. **So I found that carefully choosing the features, is even more important for anomaly detection, than for supervised learning approaches**. Let's take a look at this video as some practical tips, for how to tune the features for anomaly detection, to try to get you the best possible performance. 

## `Non Gaussian features`

> So when I'm building an anomaly detection system, I'll sometimes take a look at my features, and if I see any highly non Gaussian by plotting histogram, I might choose transformations like these or others, In order to try to make it more Gaussian.
