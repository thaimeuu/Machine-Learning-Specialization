> So you've seen the process of how to build an anomaly detection system. **But how do you choose the parameter epsilon?** And how do you know if your anomaly detection system is working well in the next video, let's dive a little bit more deeply into the process of developing and evaluating the performance of an anomaly detection system. Let's go on to the next video
