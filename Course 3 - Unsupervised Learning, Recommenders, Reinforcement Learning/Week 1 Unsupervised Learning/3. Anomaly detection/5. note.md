## `Anomaly detection vs. supervised learning`

> When you have a few positive examples with y = 1 and a large number of negative examples say y = 0? When should you use anomaly detection and when should you use supervised learning? **The decision is actually quite subtle in some applications.** So let me share with you some thoughts and some suggestions for how to pick between these two types of algorithms.

> **anomaly detection algorithm** will typically be the more appropriate choice **when you have a very small number of positive examples**, 0-20 positive examples is not uncommon and **a relatively large number of negative examples** with which to try to build a model for p of x. 

> In contrast, if you have **a larger number of positive and negative examples,** then **supervised learning** might be more applicable.
