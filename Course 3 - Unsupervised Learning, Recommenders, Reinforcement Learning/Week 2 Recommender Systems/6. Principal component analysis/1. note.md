## `Reducing the number of features (optional)`

> PCA, or principal components analysis is an algorithm that lets you take data with a lot of features, 50, 1,000, even more, and reduce the number of features to two features, maybe three features, so that you can plot it and visualize it. Is commonly used by data scientists to visualize the data, to figure out what might be going on.
