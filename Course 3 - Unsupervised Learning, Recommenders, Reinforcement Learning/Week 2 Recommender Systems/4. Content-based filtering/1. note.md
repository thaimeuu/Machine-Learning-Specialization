## `Collaborative filtering vs Content-based filtering`

> In this video, we'll start to develop a second type of recommender system called a content-based filtering algorithm. To get started, let's compare and contrast the collaborative filtering approach that we'll be looking at so far with this new content-based filtering approach.

> Given features like this, the task is to try to figure out whether a given movie i is going to be good match for user j.

> Notice that whereas x_u and x_m could be different in size, one could be very long lists of numbers, one could be much shorter list, v here have to be the same size. 

> To summarize, in collaborative filtering, we had number of users give ratings of different items. In contrast, in content-based filtering, we have features of users and features of items and we want to find a way to find good matches between the users and the items. The way we're going to do so is to compute these vectors, v_u for the users and v_m for the items over the movies, and then take dot products between them to try to find good matches. How do we compute the v_u and v_m? Let's take a look at that in the next video.
