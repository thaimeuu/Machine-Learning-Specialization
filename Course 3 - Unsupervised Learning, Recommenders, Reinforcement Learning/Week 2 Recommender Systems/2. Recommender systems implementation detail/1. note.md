## `Mean normalization`

> Back in the first course, you have seen how for linear regression, feature normalization can help the algorithm run faster. In the case of building a recommender system with numbers wide such as movie ratings from one to five or zero to five stars, it turns out your algorithm will run more efficiently. And also perform a bit better if you first carry out mean normalization. That is if you normalize the movie ratings to have a consistent average value, let's take a look at what that means.

> So that's mean normalization. It makes the algorithm run a little bit faster. But even more important, it makes the algorithm give much better, much more reasonable predictions when there are users that rated very few movies or even no movies at all. This implementation detail of mean normalization will make your recommended system work much better. Next, let's go into the next video to talk about how you can implement this for yourself in TensorFlow.
