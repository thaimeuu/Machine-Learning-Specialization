## `Collaborative filtering algorithm`

> In the last video, you saw how if you have features for each movie, such as features x_1 and x_2 that tell you how much is this a romance movie and how much is this an action movie. Then you can use basically linear regression to learn to predict movie ratings. But what if you don't have those features, x_1 and x_2? **Let's take a look at how you can learn or come up with those features x_1 and x_2 from the data.**

> How do you minimize this cost function as a function of w, b, and x? One thing you could do is to use gradient descent.

> So far, our problem formulation has used movie ratings from 1- 5 stars or from 0- 5 stars. A very common use case of recommender systems is when you have binary labels such as that the user favors, or like, or interact with an item. In the next video, let's take a look at a generalization of the model that you've seen so far to binary labels. Let's go see that in the next video.
