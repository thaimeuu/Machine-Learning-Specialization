## `Using per-item features`

> So let's take a look at how we can develop a recommender system if we had features of each item, or features of each movie.

- n<sub>u</sub> = 4: the number of users
- n<sub>m</sub> = 5: the number of movies
- n = 2: the number of features

- w<sup>j</sup>, b<sup>j</sup> are the parameters of user j<sup>th</sup>.
- x<sup>i</sup> is the feature of movie i<sup>th</sup>.

## `Notations`

- With regularization term:

- Usually, we **eliminate the denominator m<sup>j</sup>** because it is just a constant for ease of use.

> So that's how you can learn parameters and predict movie ratings, if you had access to these features X1 and X2. That tell you how much is each of the movies, a romance movie, and how much is each of the movies an action movie? 

> But where do these features come from? And what if you don't have access to such features that give you enough detail about the movies with which to make these predictions? In the next video, we'll look at the modification of this algorithm.
