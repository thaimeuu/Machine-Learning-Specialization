> If you command it to go left, it has a 90 percent chance or 0.9 chance of correctly going in the left direction. But the 0.1 chance of actually heading to the right so that it has a 90 percent chance of ending up in state three in this example and a 10 percent chance of ending up in state five. Conversely, if you were to command it to go right and take the action, right, it has a 0.9 chance of ending up in state five and 0.1 chance of ending up in state three. This would be an example of a stochastic environment.
