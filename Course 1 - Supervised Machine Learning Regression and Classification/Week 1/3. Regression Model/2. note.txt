1. How a Regression model works?

- feed training set to algorithm
- algorithm gives function f
- function f takes in "input x" and returns "output y-hat" (y with hat)

2. In machine learning convention, y-hat is the prediction for y.

- The function f is called the model
- x is called input feature
- y without hat is a true value, an actual value in the dataset
- y-hat is called prediction (may or may not be the true value)

3. How to represent f function? What kind of math to compute f?

- Assume f is a straight line:
    We have f_w,b(x) = wx+b  (_ denotes a SUBSCRIPT of f) (w and b are numbers)
    f_w,b(x) takes in x and returns y-hat.
    --> This f function is called "a LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL with ONE variable - feature x"
    --> Other name: UNIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION
