1. In linear regression model f_w,b(x)=wx+b,

w,b: parameters/coefficients/weights

in particular, 
w: weight
b: bias

2. Cost function in ML

is also called "Squared Error Cost Function"
is to find w,b so that y-hat(i) is close to y(i) of each training example (x(i), y(i))

J(w,b) = 1/2m * sum((y-hat(i) - y(i))^2) for i in range(1, m+1)
J(w,b) is cost function
m is the number of training examples
