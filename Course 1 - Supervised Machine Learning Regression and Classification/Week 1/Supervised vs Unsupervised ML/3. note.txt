1. Classification

Breast cancer detection is an example of Classification
The model predicts whether a tumor is 
either malignant: cancerous
or benign: non-cancerous

The difference of Classification from Regression is that:
The Classification model only tries to predict 1 answer out of "limited choices/answers/possibilities"
while Regression tries to predict 1 answer out of infinite answers

2. In Classification, the term "output classes" and "output categories" are used interchangeably

3. In conclusion, Classification model predicts categories (cat or dog, malignant or benign, 0 or 1 or 2, etc.)
Classification model predicts one answer out of a small number of possible values.

4. Classification algorithm can take in multiple inputs (e.g. 'age' and 'tumor size' --> 'malignant' or 'benign')
