### FEATURE ENGINEERING

***Question: How to choose the appropriate features for your model?***

**Feature engineering**: Using **intuition** to design **new features**, by transforming or combining original features

*EXAMPLE*: If you have the training set that contains 3 features of a pool: length, width, height, you can make the 4<sup>th</sup> feature by taking the product of those 3 features. Now you have the 4<sup>th</sup> feature as the **volume** of the pool. This is reasonable because the **volume** might be important when it comes to **pool's price**
