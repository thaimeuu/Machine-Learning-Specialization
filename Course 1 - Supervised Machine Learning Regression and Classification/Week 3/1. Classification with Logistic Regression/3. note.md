### LOGISTIC REGRESSION

- **Logistic Regression** fits a curve to the training set. This curve is called the **sigmoid function** or the **logistic function**
- The **logistic function** or the curve fitted to the training set looks like this:

- Where:
  - g(z): logistic function
  - 0 < g(z) < 1
  - if z is +&infin;, g(z) is approximately 1
  - if z is -&infin;, g(z) is approximately 0

### LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL

- Logistic regression model looks like this:

![Alt text](<3. logistic regression model.png>)

- g(z) = 1/(1 + e<sup>-z</sup>) or
- g(dot(**w**, **x**) + b) = 1/(1 + e<sup>-(dot(**w**, **x**) + b)</sup>)

### NOTE

- **Logistic regression model** returns a value that denotes the probability that the target y is 1, given input **x** and parameters **w**, b.

- As a result, sometimes the model is written like this: f<sub>w,b</sub> = P(y=1 | **x**; **w**,b)
