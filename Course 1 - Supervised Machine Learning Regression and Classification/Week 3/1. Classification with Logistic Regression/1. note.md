## WEEK 3: CLASSIFICATION

This week, you'll learn the other type of supervised learning, classification. You'll learn how to predict categories using the logistic regression model. You'll learn about the problem of overfitting, and how to handle this problem with a method called regularization. You'll get to practice implementing logistic regression with regularization at the end of this week!

### MOTIVATIONS

- The type of **classification** algorithm that predicts either one of only **2 outputs** (e.g. yes or no, false or true, 0 or 1) is called **Binary classification**
- **Binary classification** predicts 1 out of 2 **classes/categories** (class and category are used **interchangeably**)
- the output **0 or false or no** is usually referred to **negative class**
- the output **1 or true or yes** is usually referred to **positive class**
