## Optional lab: Cost function for logistic regression

This optional lab will show you how the logistic cost function is implemented in code.  You will get to implement this later in the practice lab at the end of the week.

This optional lab also shows you how two different choices of the parameters will lead to different cost calculations.  So you can see in a plot that the better fitting decision boundary has a lower cost relative to another choice for a decision boundary.
