## Optional lab: Logistic loss

In this optional lab, you’ll get to take a look at how the squared error cost doesn’t work very well for classification, because you’ll see a surface plot of a very wiggly cost surface with many local minima.

Then, you’ll get to take a look at the new logistic loss function, and see that this produces a nice and smooth surface plot that does not have several local minima.
