### Optional lab: Overfitting

In this optional lab, you’ll take a look at some examples of overfitting that you can adjust by clicking on the options in the plot.  In the lab you’ll be able to add your own data points by clicking on the plot, and see how that changes the fitted curve.

You can try examples for both regression and classification.  You can also change the degree of the polynomial to see how the curve either overfits or underfits the data.
