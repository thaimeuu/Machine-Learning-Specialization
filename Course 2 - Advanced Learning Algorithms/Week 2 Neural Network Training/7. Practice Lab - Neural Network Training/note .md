## `Programming Assignment: Practice Lab: Neural Networks for Multiclass classification`

Welcome to this second assignment of course 2.  In this exercise, you will extend last weeks assignment to recognize digits 0-9. You will explore the popular ReLu activation as well as the use of the Softmax activation in multiclass classification.  You will then build a neural network capable of multiclass classification using the ReLu and Softmax in Tensorflow.
