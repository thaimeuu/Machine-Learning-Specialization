## `Additional Layer Types`

All the layers we have seen and used are of **Dense** type, let's look at **Additional Layer Types**

### `Convolutional layer`

A **Convolutional layer** doesn't have access to all the activations in the previous Layer like **Dense layer**. 

Instead, each neuron inside a **Convolutional layer** only looks at a part of the previous layer's outputs.

This helps with:
- Faster computation
- Need less training data
