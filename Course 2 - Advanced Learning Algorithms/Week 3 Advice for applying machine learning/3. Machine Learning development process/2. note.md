## `Error analysis`

> In terms of the most important ways to help you run diagnostics to choose what to try next to improve your learning algorithm performance, I would say bias and variance is probably the most important idea and error analysis would probably be second on my list.

## `Example`

- Say, you **manually** examine 100 misclassified examples and find out that:
  - 21/100 are pharma-related
  - 18/100 are phishing
  - a minority belongs to other categories
- You can then take actions to address the major issues:
  - Collect more data on pharma
  - Add new features
- You can consider to skip minor issues because they can take up much time with little effects.
