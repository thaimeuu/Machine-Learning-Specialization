## `Transfer learning: using data from a different task`

> For an application where you don't have that much data, transfer learning is a wonderful technique that lets you use data from a different task to help on your application.

- PROBLEM STATEMENT: You want to classify a sets of hand-written digits. However, you don't have many training examples. One way to train your model is to train it from, for instance, 1 million available images of 1,000 classes (dogs, cats, ...). You can then **fine tune** your model by changing the **output layer** and its parameters that apply to your task of hand-written digits. **All of the hidden layers' parameters remains the same.**
