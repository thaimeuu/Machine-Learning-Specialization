```
One way to evaluate a model is to split the dataset into 2 subsets:
- Training set (Larger half)
- Test set (Smaller half)
```

## `Evaluating a linear regression model`

```
1. Use regularization to minimize the cost function
2. Compute test error to know how well the model predicts on test set
3. Compute training error to know how well the model predicts on training set
```

## `Evaluating a logistic regression model`

```
In logistic regression:
- Test error indicates the fraction of the test set that has been misclassified
- Train error indicates the fraction of the train set that has been misclassified
```
