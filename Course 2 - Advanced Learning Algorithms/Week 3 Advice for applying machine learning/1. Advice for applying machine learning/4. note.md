## `Model selection and training/cross validation/test sets`

- In most cases, the **training error J<sub>train</sub>** is not an indicator of how well the model performs.
- On the other hand, **J<sub>test</sub>** is a better estimate of how well the model generalizes to new data.

## `How to choose a model`

We can split our dataset into 3 subsets:
- Training set
- Cross validation
- Test set

You will use **J<sub>cv</sub>** for selecting a model and **J<sub>test</sub>** to measure the generalization error of the model.

## `Example`

```
Let's say we are considering 3 models, we should go through the following procedure:
- Train all 3 models
- Choose the model with the lowest J_cv
- Estimate generalization error using the test set: J_test
```
