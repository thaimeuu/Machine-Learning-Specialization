## `Error metrics for skewed datasets`

> A skewed data set is characterized by a data curve that's asymmetrical and skewed to the left or right side of a graph

## `Precision and Recall`

- Two **error metrics** that are used to assess the performance of your model on a skewed dataset are:
  - Precision
  - Recall
- A high precision and recall (max_value = 1) indicates a good performance.

> So when you have skewed classes or a rare class that you want to detect, precision and recall helps you tell if your learning algorithm is making good predictions or useful predictions. 

> In the next video, let's take a look at how to trade-off between precision and recall to try to optimize the performance of your learning algorithm.
