## `Establishing a baseline level of performance`

### `Example: Speech Recognition`

- In **speech recognition** task:
  - **Training error J<sub>train</sub>** refers to the percentage of the input audio to which your model doesn't transcribe correctly.
  - **Cross validation error J<sub>cv</sub>** refers to the performance of your model in the corresponding set.
- Intuitively, we can conclude that the model in the image below has a high bias and high variance because 10.8% and 14.8% errors seem pretty high.
- However, there is another thing we should consider that is the **human level performance**.

### `Human level performance`

- Considering that the input radio can sometimes be noisy, **Human level performance** refers to how well a human can transcribe the same **input audio**.

- Comparing the **training error J<sub>train</sub>** to the **human level performance**, we can conclude that the model does pretty well on the **training set**. However, a 4% gap between J<sub>train</sub> and J<sub>cv</sub> indicates that the model has a high variance.

### `Establishing a baseline level of performance`

- It turns out that to judge the performance of a model, it is useful to create a **baseline level of performance** like **human level performance**.
- A **baseline level of performance** refers to what **percentage/level of error** is acceptable.

- A **baseline level of performance** can be:
  - Human level performance: How well can a human do the same tasks as the model does.
  - Competing algorithms performance: Old performance of the model in other implementations.
  - Guess based on experience.

### `Bias/variance examples`

- We can conclude whether a model has a high bias or a high variance based on the gap between:
  - **the baseline level of performance** and **the training error**: refers to bias problem
  - **the training error** and **cross validation error**: refers to variance problem
