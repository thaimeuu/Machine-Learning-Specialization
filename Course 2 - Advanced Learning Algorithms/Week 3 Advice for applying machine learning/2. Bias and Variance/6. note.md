## `Bias/variance and neural networks`

- NEURAL NETWORKS have been so successful because they give us new ways to address both HIGH BIAS and HIGH VARIANCE.

### `Large neural networks are low bias machines`

- As long as your **training set isn't enormous** or your **neural network is big enough**, your model is unlikely to have a HIGH BIAS problem.

### `Summary`

- It hardly ever hurts to have a larger neural networks as long as you regularize appropriately. It can only slow down your algorithm but shouldn't hurt your performance. 
- As long as the training set is not enormous, large neural networks are usually low bias machines.
