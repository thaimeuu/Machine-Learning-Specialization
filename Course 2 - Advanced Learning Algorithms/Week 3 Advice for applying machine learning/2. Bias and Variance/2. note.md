## `Regularization and bias/variance`

### `Course 1 Reminder`

- lambda helps keep the **weights** small. However, value choice of lambda leads to different scenarios
  - with too large lambda, the model will underfit (high bias)
  - with too small lambda, the model will overfit
- Luckily, **cross validation** gives you a way to choose an appropriate lambda.

### `How to choose lambda`

- You can choose **lambda** by trying different values of lambda and choose the one that has the lowest **cross validation cost J<sub>cv</sub>**

- We have talked a lot about whether the cost is **large or small** but we don't know if a cost is considered large or not. In the next lesson, we will learn about that - **defining the large and small cost.**
