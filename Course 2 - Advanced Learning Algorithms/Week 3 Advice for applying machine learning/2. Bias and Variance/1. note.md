## `Diagnosing bias and variance`

- In machine learning we can refer:
  - underfitting to **high bias**
  - overfitting to **high variance**
- However, to **diagnose the bias and variance** of a model, we can't always plot the graph below because most models have more than 1 feature

- To **diagnose the bias and variance**, we can compute J<sub>train</sub> and J<sub>cv</sub>.
  - If **J<sub>train</sub>** is high, the model has a **high bias**
  - If **J<sub>cv</sub>** is high, the model has a **high variance**
