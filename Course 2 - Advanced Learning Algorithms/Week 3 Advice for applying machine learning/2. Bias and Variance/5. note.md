## `Deciding what to try next revisited`

- **PROBLEM STATEMENT**: You've got a sense about your model if it has a **high bias** or a **high variance** problem. WHAT SHOULD WE DO NEXT?

### `What to do?`

- Below is the picture we have seen before. 
- All 6 solutions listed in the picture either help fix **high bias** or **high variance** problem.
- Fix **high bias** by:
  - Try getting additional features (3)
  - Try adding polynomial features (4)
  - Try decreasing lambda (5)
- Fix **high variance** by:
  - Get more training examples (1)
  - Try smaller sets of features (2)
  - Try increasing lambda (6)
