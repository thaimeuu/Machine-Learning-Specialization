## `Sampling with replacement`

> In order to build a tree ensemble, we're going to need a technique called sampling with replacement. Let's take a look at what that means.

- Sampling with replacement means picking 1 example at a time and put that example back down before picking the 2<sup>nd</sup> example. In this way, we have no bias (every example have the same possibility of getting picked every time).
- In the example below, say we have 4 tokens of 4 colors. We perform `Sampling with replacement` 4 times and have the results as follows:
