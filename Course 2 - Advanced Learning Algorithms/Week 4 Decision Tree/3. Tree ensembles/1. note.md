## `Using multiple decision trees`

> One of the weaknesses of using a single decision tree is that that decision tree can be highly sensitive to small changes in the data. One solution to make the algorithm less sensitive or more robust is to build not one decision tree, but to build a lot of decision trees, and we call that a tree ensemble.

- Changing only one example in the dataset may result in a complete different tree.

## `Tree ensemble`

- Try new examples on the ensemble of trees and vote for the final prediction.
