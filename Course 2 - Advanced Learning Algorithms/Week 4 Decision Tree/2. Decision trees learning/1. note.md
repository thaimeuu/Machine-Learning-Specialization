## `Measuring purity`

> In this video, we'll look at the way of measuring the **purity** of a set of examples. If the examples are all cats of **a single class** then that's **very pure**, if it's all not cats that's also very pure, but if it's somewhere in between how do you quantify how pure is the set of examples? 

## `Entropy is the measure of the impurity of the data.`

- Entropy - **H(p<sub>1</sub>)** is a curve that ranges from 0 to 1
- Specifically:
  - **H(p<sub>1</sub>)** = 1 (most impure) when p<sub>1</sub> equals 0.5
  - **H(p<sub>1</sub>)** = 0 (most pure) when p<sub>1</sub> equals to 0.0 or 1.0
