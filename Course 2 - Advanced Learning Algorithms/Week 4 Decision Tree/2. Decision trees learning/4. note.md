### `One hot encoding`

- Instead of having one feature that can take 3 values as previously, **One hot encoding** creates 3 features that each of which can take only 0 or 1.

### `One hot encoding and neural networks`

- One-hot encoding makes decision tree possible using neural networks which take their inputs as numerical values.

> But how about features that are numbers that can take on any value, not just a small number of discrete values. In the next video let's look at how you can get the decision tree to handle continuous value features that can be any number.
