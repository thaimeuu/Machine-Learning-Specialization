Dense function in tensorflow

In TensorFlow, the Dense layer is a commonly used layer in neural networks. It represents a fully connected layer, where each neuron or node in the layer is connected to every neuron in the previous layer. The Dense layer is a fundamental building block for constructing neural networks.
```

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Activation of input layer: a_0 or x
x = np.array([[200.0, 17.0]])  # 1 example of 2 features
x.shape  # (1, 2) --> 1 example of 2 features
layer_1 = Dense(units=3, activation='sigmoid')
a1 = layer_1(x)  # Feed a_0 or x in order to get a_1

layer_2 = Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')
a2 = layer_2(a1)  # Similar explanation

# Model prediction
if a2 >= 0.5:
    y_hat = 1
else:
    y_hat = 0

```
