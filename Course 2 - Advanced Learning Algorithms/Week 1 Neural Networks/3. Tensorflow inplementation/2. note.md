## `Data in TensorFlow`

### `How does tensorflow handle data?`

**tensorflow** has some conflicts when working with **numpy**

**tensorflow** wants its data to be a matrix in the form of **tf.Tensor** object, whereas **numpy** wants its data to be **ndarray**

So when we use **ndarray** to work with **tensorflow**, **tensorflow** will automatically convert **ndarray** into **tf.Tensor**. If we want to convert the data type back to ndarray, use .numpy() as a method of tf.Tensor

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

x = np.array([[200., 17.]])  # tensorflow works with MATRIX 
layer_1 = Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')
a1 = layer_1(x)

# x is ndarray and a1 is tf.Tensor
# x and a1 are both MATRICES

# Convert a1 back to ndarray
a1.numpy()

```
