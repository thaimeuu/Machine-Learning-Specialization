## `Demand Prediction`

```
Demand prediction is to look at a product and predict whether the product is a best-seller or not

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

You want to predict if a T-SHIRT is going to be a top seller or not based on the T-SHIRT's price, shipping cost, marketing and material
```

```
The PROBABILITY of being a top seller of the T-SHIRT may be predicted from 3 features, which are AFFORDABILITY, AWARENESS and QUALITY

- AFFORDABILITY can be predicted from 2 features that are PRICE and SHIPPING COST

- AWARENESS can be predicted from MARKETING

- QUALITY can be predicted from PRICE and MATERIAL
```

```
As a result, We make 3 neurons where each neuron inputs 1 or more features from the given 4 (PRICE, SHIPPING COST, MARKETING, MATERIAL) and then outputs the according prediction (AFFORDABILITY, AWARENESS, QUALITY). 

We also create 1 neuron that inputs 3 features above and makes a prediction for the PROBABILITY of the T-SHIRT being a top seller

A NEURAL NETWORK CAN HAVE MULTIPLE LAYERS

A LAYER is a group of neurons or a single neuron that INPUTS the similar features and OUTPUTS a few numbers together

- The input layer is not specifically a "Neuron layer". It contains all the initial features that will be passed to "Neurons".

- The second layer is a group of 3 neurons whose outputs are called "ACTIVATIONS". Activation is a term to describe the "OUTPUT of a NEURON".

- The third layer is called the OUTPUT LAYER because its output is the output of the NEURAL NETWORK. The third layer consists of 1 neuron whose ACTIVATION is the "PROBABILITY OF THE T-SHIRT BEING A TOP SELLER"
```

```
RECAP

The 2nd LAYER inputs 4 numbers from the INPUT LAYER and outputs 3 number.

The OUTPUT LAYER inputs those 3 numbers and outputs the final number which is the prediction of the NEURAL NETWORK

```
In practice, a single NEURON will have access to all the features and values from the previous LAYER. This helps minimize our manual work to decide which features are for AFFORDABILITY, ...

A neuron can decide which features are more important and which are less
```

```
To simplify, we conventionally assume each neuron inputs a vector and outputs a vector

- The INPUT LAYER feeds vector x to the next layer

- The HIDDEN LAYER (neither INPUT LAYER nor OUTPUT LAYER) inputs vector x and outputs vector a (ACTIVATIONS)

- The OUTPUT LAYER inputs vector a and outputs another vector a
```

```
Another way to think of NEURAL NETWORK is that NEURAL NETWORK is just a classification algorithm.

However, NEURAL NETWORK itself creates a set of relevant/useful features by combining features from the previous LAYER. Note that all this work is done by itself, which means we don't have to specify AFFORDABILITY nor AWARENESS, ...
